# HindiHandWritingRecognition
A simple Hindi Alphabet classifier using convnet. It will help you classify different Hindi alphabets. Techniques used are convolution neural networks, Tensorflow as a framework and Keras API for providing a high level abstraction.

You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

I have used convolutional neural networks. I am using Tensorflow as the framework and Keras API for providing a high level of abstraction.
