# HindiHandWritingRecognition:
A simple Hindi Alphabet classifier using convnet. It will help you classify different Hindi alphabets. Techniques used are convolution neural networks, Tensorflow as a framework and Keras API for providing a high level abstraction.

# Code Requirements:
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

# Techniques used:
I have used convolutional neural networks. I am using Tensorflow as the framework and Keras API for providing a high level of abstraction.

# Python Implementation: 
1. Dataset- DHCD (Devnagari Character Dataset)
2. Images of size 32 X 32
3. Convolutional Network Support added.
